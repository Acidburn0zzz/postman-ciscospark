# Code generation with postman 

Postman lets you [generate code](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/code_snippets) in up to 15 languages.

Simply select on a REST request in your collection, and click on the **Code** link, right under the Save button.

As the code generation popup opens, pick your favorite language from the combo.

Check the code generated by postman.

If you look at it carefully, you'll notice two extra headers "postman-token" and "cache-control". These can be removed manually.

For example, here is the code you'll get if you ask postman to generate a nodejs/request code snippet, after removal of the extra headers.
